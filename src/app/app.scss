// App Global Sass
// --------------------------------------------------
// Put style rules here that you want to apply globally. These
// styles are for the entire app and not just one component.
// Additionally, this file can be also used as an entry point
// to import other Sass files to be included in the output CSS.
//
// Shared Sass variables, which can be used to adjust Ionic's
// default Sass variables, belong in "theme/variables.scss".
//
// To declare rules for a specific mode, create a child rule
// for the .md, .ios, or .wp mode classes. The mode class is
// automatically applied to the <body> element in the app.


//enable ezAR video to show through <body> element
body {
    background-color: transparent;
}

//enable ezAR video to show through ionic app's root component
//hack: prevents theme specific overriding of background-color
ion-app {
    background-color: transparent !important;
}
